## Useful To know:
- Bins are like folders where you can upload files. They can be downloaded, updated with files, locked and deleted
- Short code is a mapping for bins that allows to remember your bin. eg: sweet-mango16 for binid A904hbhu897SAD4Q
- Bins are auto deleted after 7 days, that is if not deleted by the user himself
- Ensures some level of privacy because the bins are made with 16 digit unique alhpanumeric id and only the people having the link(or short code) can access the content
---

## Features

- **Upload :** one or multiple files to a new or existing bin.
- **Shortcode Access :**: Use **human-readable shortcodes** like `good-apple81` or `sweet-mango37` instead of remembering long bin IDs to interact with bins and files.
- **Download :** As simple files or download complete bin as archive (tar and zip supported)
- **List :** the contents of any bin with basic or detailed metadata.
- **Lock :** a bin to make it read-only.
- **Delete :** an entire bin permanently.
